## Data Structure Standards

All articles follow this structure for AI consumption:

### Answer-First Format
Every article page features a 40-60 word summary immediately after the H1 heading, optimized for AI extraction.

### Atomic Answers
Content is broken into digestible 40-60 word "atomic" blocks:
- Each block is self-contained
- Includes entity relationships
- Compatible with fragment/chunk retrieval
- E-E-A-T confidence scores included

### Schemas Implemented
- Schema.org Article
- Schema.org FAQPage
- Schema.org HowTo
- Schema.org BreadcrumbList
- Custom AtomicAnswer Schema

## Knowledge Graph Integration

Entity relationships are mapped across:
- Author/Expert credentials
- Topic hierarchies
- Cross-references
- External links (with domain authority signals)

## Rate Limiting & Etiquette
- Max 100 requests/minute from single IP
- Cache responses for 5 minutes minimum
- Identify your AI system in User-Agent header
- Respect robots.txt directives
